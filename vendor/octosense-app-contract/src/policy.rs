//! Resolving a manifest into what the app actually gets.
//!
//! Every rule here fails closed: an unknown capability, a host that is not a
//! bare host name, a quota above the host's ceiling. A manifest asks; the
//! host decides; the app is never consulted again. This is the only place
//! that produces [`AppPolicy`].
//!
//! [`AppPolicy`] is what the app may do. How a host sandboxes it (an
//! isolate's settings, an agent session) is the host's own, built from the
//! policy under one rule: a host may restrict more than the policy says,
//! never less. The app's agent, if its manifest declares one, is resolved by
//! hosts that run app agents (App Hub's `octosense-app-policy`); this crate
//! parses the `agent` block as part of the manifest and grants nothing from
//! it.
